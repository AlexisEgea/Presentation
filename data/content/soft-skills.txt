In addition to the core soft skills expected from an engineer, I cultivate a set of personal qualities that I consider essential for successfully carrying out any mission:

- **Problem-solving**: Approaching complex challenges with Creativity, Innovation, and Rigor
- **Adaptability**: Quickly adjusting to new environments, tools, and constraints
- **Autonomy**: Taking initiative and driving tasks forward independently when required
- **Time management**: Organizing work effectively to meet deadlines and maintain high quality
- **Attention to detail**: Ensuring precision and reliability in every aspect of a project
- **Communication**: Fostering clear and effective communication within technical teams and with non-technical stakeholders
- **Continuous learning**: Staying curious and constantly enriching my knowledge and skills
