[Section] About Me
My name is Alexis Egea, and I will graduate in **Computer Science Engineering** in September 2025.

I chose to become an engineer because I have always been passionate about imagining the world of tomorrow.  
Driven by a strong sense of creativity, I strive to design solutions that make everyday life simpler, more seamless, and more efficient.

Solving complex problems is a true driving force for me.  
It constantly pushes me to go beyond my limits and explore new horizons.  
With the emergence of breakthrough technologies like Artificial Intelligence, this dynamic has accelerated dramatically, opening up unprecedented opportunities for innovation.

Computer science allows me to bring my ideas to life: I can imagine, visualize, and develop concrete solutions by implementing the features I envision.  
Every mission, project, and challenge becomes a source of inspiration for future endeavors, helping me to continuously grow.

Imagining, designing, and developing such solutions is what motivates me daily.  
I draw inspiration from many areas: everyday life, online information, cinema, TV series, and particularly video games with complex and immersive mechanics.

[Section] Focus in Software Development
I believe that software development is not only about writing code, but about creating a project that lives and evolves, a solution that delivers real value to its users.

I aim to design software that fully meets the clientâ€™s specifications and business needs, while ensuring a reliable, well-documented, and well-organized architecture.  
I also focus on writing modular, maintainable, and easily interchangeable code, and strive to deliver optimal performance and efficiency.

[Section] Focus Areas in Artificial Intelligence
I have a strong interest in AI and specialize in three particular areas:
1. **Generative AI**: Data Generation, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Prompt Engineering.
2. **Combinatorial AI**: Development of intelligent bots for video games, strategic decision-making, pathfinding, adaptive behaviors in dynamic environments.
3. **AI for Autonomous Vehicles**: Designing real-time decision-making algorithms for complex and dynamic environments.

[Section] Technical Skills
thanks to the excellent courses I have followed, I have built a solid foundation in Computer Science, particularly in Programming.

This mastery of algorithms allows me to be independent of any specific programming language and adapt easily to different contexts and environments.  
I have worked with more than 10 programming languages, with the main ones being **Java**, **Python**, and **C++**.

Where I have improved the most is in my ability to:  
- Conduct effective research  
- Document myself autonomously  
- Adapt quickly to new tools and technologies  
- Continuously progress, day after day

My philosophy is to explore ever broader horizons, push beyond the limits of what is possible, and deliver innovative solutions to complex problems.
