Through the theoretical knowledge I acquired during my university studies and engineering school, combined with hands-on experience gained through academic, professional, and personal projects, I have been able to learn a wide range of programming techniques and work with numerous languages and libraries.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of programming paradigms I have explored:
- Imperative Programming
- Recursive Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functional Programming
- Concurrent Programming
- Logical Programming

In addition, thanks to my specialization in Artificial Intelligence, I have gained experience with several Machine Learning approaches:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Learning
- Transfer Learning

My continuous learning mindset, versatility, and adaptability allow me to work independently of any specific programming language.
Exploring new languages and libraries is an integral part of my daily routine and a constant driver for expanding my technical horizons.

Among the many languages I have worked with, the ones I use most frequently are Python, Java, and C++.
